Iâ€™m a Computer Engineering student at Obafemi Awolowo University with a keen interest in Full stack web development. Over the past three years, Iâ€™ve been developing my skills through personal projects, working with a range of technologies:

Skills:
	â€¢	Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python
	â€¢	Frameworks/Libraries: Bootstrap, SASS, Tailwind, React, Django (learning), Express (learning)
	â€¢	Databases: MySQL, MongoDB
	â€¢	Tools: Git (for version control)

Iâ€™ve completed around 10 projects, each helping me improve in building responsive and user-friendly applications. As I continue my studies, Iâ€™m excited to deepen my expertise in both front-end and back-end development.

Iâ€™m open to internships, mentorship, freelance roles and partnering on side projects.
